# Weather Web App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Developing the app

Add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to `public/index.html`.

The build step will place the bundled scripts into the
`public/index.html` `<body>` tag.

To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.

To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
